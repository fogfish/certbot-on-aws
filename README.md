# CertBot on AWS

The project provides a serverless integration with https://letsencrypt.org for microservices hosted on AWS.

You should only use this solution only if you are not able to utilize AWS ELB otherwise just takes a benefits from free usage of AWS Certificates service.

The project provides AWS CodeBuild scripts that obtains a wildcard certificate from Letâ€™s Encrypt on on a machine other than target servers, using [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org) and its AWS Route53 [plugin](https://certbot-dns-route53.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Project automates periodic code build execution that either fetches a new certificate or re-new existed one. Certificates are stored in S3 bucket within your account. 

## Getting Started

The latest version of all artifacts is available at `master` branch. All development, including new features and bug fixes, take place on the `master` branch using forking and pull requests. All latest artifacts are available at Docker Hub.

Configure CertBot for your domain. Please keep in-mind that following command assumes that you have access to AWS account and command-line tools.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fogfish/certbot-on-aws
cd certbot-on-aws

make aws \
   S3=s3://my-secret-bucket-for-keys/letsencrypt \
   EMAIL=my@contact.email \
   DOMAIN=my.domain.com
```

The command spawns serverless resources required to obtain wildcard certificate for your domain and triggers a AWS CodeBuild project for the first time. After that, renewal is triggered every 1st day of each month.

You'll find specified keys in S3 bucket!!!

## Hacking

* Cloud Formation [template](aws.yml) spawn all resources required by project 
* [Build specification](buildspec.yml) orchestrates `certbot` processes
